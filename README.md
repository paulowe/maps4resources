## About Sub Maps

This is a branch created from the master. It is specifically for making changes to the architecture of the resource map so that as an admin you can create sub-maps. This is the current active project for now. All changes will eventually be merged back into master once I am done with the project. 

Feel free to submit PRs and contirbute your changes.
