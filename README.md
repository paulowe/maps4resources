## About Sub Maps

This is a branch created from master. It is specifically for making changes to the architecture of the resource map so that as an admin you can dynamically create sub-maps and generate new subdomains for each map. At the moment this is the main feature we are actively working on. All changes will eventually be merged back into master once we complete the feature.
